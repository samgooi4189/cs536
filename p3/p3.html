<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p class="reg">For this assignment you will use the parser-generator <b>Java Cup</b>
to write a parser for the Mini language.
The parser will find syntax errors, and for syntactically correct programs,
it will build an abstract-syntax tree (AST) representation of the program.
You will also write methods to <b>unparse</b> the AST built by
your parser, and an input file to test your parser. A main program, 
<a href="./files/P3.java"><tt>P3.java</tt></a>, that
calls the parser and then the unparser is  provided for you to use.
You will be graded on the correctness of your parser and your unparse methods,
and on how thoroughly your input file tests the parser.
In particular, you should write an input file that causes  the action associated with every grammar rule in your Java CUP specification to be executed at least once.</p>

<p class="reg">
Skeleton files on which you should build are in:
<tt>~cs536-1/public/html/assignments/p3/files</tt>
</p>
<p class="reg">
The files are:
</p>

<ul class="reg">
  <li><a href="./files/Mini.jlex"><tt>Mini.jlex</tt></a>:
       A JLex specification for the Mini language (a solution to program 2).
       Use this if there were problems with your JLex specification.</li>
  <li><a href="./files/Mini.cup"><tt>Mini.cup</tt></a>:
       A Java CUP specification for a very small subset of the Mini
       language (you will need to add to this file).</li>
  <li><a href="./files/Mini.grammar"><tt>Mini.grammar</tt></a>:
       A CFG for the Mini language.  Use this to guide the enhancements
       you make to <tt>Mini.cup</tt>.</li>
  <li><a href="./files/ast.java"><tt>ast.java</tt></a>:
       Contains class definitions for the AST structure that the parser
       will build (you will need to add unparsing code to this file, but         you should <em>not</em> add any new classes, fields, or methods).</li>
  <li><a href="./files/P3.java"><tt>P3.java</tt></a>:
       The main program that calls the parser, then, for a successful
       parse, calls the unparser (no changes needed).
       To compile P3 then run it, using <tt>test.Mini</tt> as the input,
       and sending the unparsed output to file <tt>test.out</tt>,
       type:
       <dir><tt>javac P3.java <br>
               java P3 test.Mini test.out </tt></dir>
       
       </li>
  <li><a href="./files/Makefile"><tt>Makefile</tt></a>: A Makefile for
       program 3 (no changes needed).</li>
  <li><a href="./files/test.Mini"><tt>test.Mini</tt></a>:
       Input for the current version of the parser (you will need to
       change this file).</li>
  <li><a href="./files/Errors.java"><tt>Errors.java</tt></a>:
       Same as for program 2 (no changes needed).</li>
</ul>

<p class="reg">
Here is a link to the Java CUP
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/manual.html">
reference manual</a>. There is also a link in the "Tools" section of the "Quick Links" menu on the course website.</p>

<h3 id="prec">Operator Precedences and Associativities</h3>
<p class="reg">
The Mini grammar in the file <tt>Mini.grammar</tt> is ambiguous;
it does not uniquely define the precedences and associativities of
the arithmetic, relational, equality, and logical operators.
You will need to add appropriate precedence and associativity declarations
to your Java CUP specification.
<ul>
  <li><p class="reg">Assignment is right associative.</p></li>
 
  <li><p class="reg">The relational
    and equality operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, and !=) are
    non-associative (i.e., expressions like <tt>a &lt; b &lt; c</tt>
    are not allowed and should cause a syntax error).
    </p></li>
    
  <li><p class="reg">All of the other binary operators are left associative. 
  </p></li>
  
    <li><p class="reg">The unary minus and not (!) operators have the highest
       precedence, then multiplication and division,
       then addition and subtraction,
       then the relational and equality operators, then the logical
       <i>and</i> operator (&amp;&amp;), then the logical <i>or</i> operator (||), and finally the assignment operator (=).
       </p></li>
</ul>
<p class="reg">
Note that the same token (MINUS) is used for both the unary and binary minus 
operator, and that they have different precedences;
however, the Mini grammar has been written so that the unary minus operator
has the correct (highest) precedence;
therefore, you can declare MINUS to have
the precedence appropriate for the binary minus operator.</p>
<p class="reg">
Java Cup will print a message telling you how many <em>conflicts</em>
it found in your grammar.
If the number is not zero, it means that your grammar is still
ambiguous, and the parser is unlikely to work correctly.
<b>Do not ignore this!</b>
Go back and fix your specification so that your grammar is not ambiguous.
</p>

<h3 id="ast">Building an Abstract-Syntax Tree</h3>
<p class="reg">
To make your parser build an abstract-syntax tree, you must add new
productions, declarations, and actions to <tt>Mini.cup</tt>.
You will need to decide, for each nonterminal that you add, what
type its associated value should have.
Then you must add the appropriate nonterminal
declaration to the specification.
For most nonterminals, the value will either be some kind of tree node
(a subclass of <tt>ASTnode</tt>) or a <tt>LinkedList</tt>
of some kind of node
(use the information in <tt>ast.java</tt> to guide your decision).
Note that you cannot use parameterized types for the types of  nonterminals;  so if the translation of a nonterminal is a <tt>LinkedList</tt>  of some kind of node, you will have to declare its type as  just plain <tt>LinkedList</tt>.  </p>
<p class="reg">You must also add actions to each new grammar production that you add to <tt>Mini.cup</tt>. Make sure that each action ends by  assigning
  an appropriate value to <tt>RESULT</tt>.
  Note that the parser will return a <tt>Symbol</tt> whose <tt>value</tt>
  field contains the value assigned to <tt>RESULT</tt> in the production
  for the root nonterminal (nonterminal <tt>program</tt>).
</p>


<h3 id="unparsing">Unparsing</h3>
<p class="reg">
To test your parser, you must write the <tt>unparse</tt>
methods for the subclasses of <tt>ASTnode</tt> (in the file <tt>ast.java</tt>).
When the <tt>unparse</tt> method of the root node of the program's
abstract-syntax tree is called, it should print a nicely formatted
version of the program (this is called <em>unparsing</em>
the abstract-syntax tree).
The output produced by calling <tt>unparse</tt> should be the
same as the input to the parser except that:
</p>
<ol class="reg">
  <li>There will be no comments in the output.</li>
  <li>The output will be &quot;pretty printed&quot; (newlines and indentation
       will be used to make the program readable); and</li>
  <li> Expressions will be fully parenthesized to reflect the order of
       evaluation.</li>
</ol>

<p class="reg">
For example, if the input program includes:
</p>
<dir>
<pre>if (b == -1) { x = 4+3*5-y; while (c) { y = y*2+x; } } else { x = 0; }
</pre>
</dir>
<p class="reg">
the output of <tt>unparse</tt> should be something like the following:
</p>
<dir>
<pre>if ((b == (-1))) {
    x = ((4 + (3 * 5)) - y);
    while (c) {
        y = ((y * 2) + x);
    }
}
else {
    x = 0;
}
</pre>
</dir>
<p class="reg">
To make grading easier, put open curly braces on the <em>same</em>
line as the preceding code and put closing curly braces on a line with no
other code (as in the example above).
Put the first statement in the body of an <tt>if</tt> or <tt>while</tt>
on the line following the open curly brace.
Whitespace within a line is up to you (as long as it looks reasonable).
</p>
<p class="reg">
Note: Trying to unparse a tree will help you determine whether you have
built the tree correctly in the first place.
Besides looking at the output of your unparser, you should try
using it as the input to your parser;
if it doesn't parse, you've made a mistake either in how you built
your abstract-syntax tree or in how you've written your unparser.
</p>
<p class="reg">
Another good way to test your code is to try compiling the output
of your unparser using the C++ compiler (g++).
If your input program uses I/O (<tt>cin</tt> or <tt>cout</tt>),
you will first need to add: <tt>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</tt>
at the beginning of the file.
</p>
<p class="reg">
It is a good idea to work incrementally
 (see <a href="#suggest">Suggestions for How to Work on This Assignment</a> below for more detailed suggestions):
 </p>
<ul class="reg">
  <li>Add a few grammar productions to <tt>Mini.cup</tt>.
  <li>Write the corresponding <tt>unparse</tt> operations.
  <li>Write a test program that uses the new language constructs.
  <li>Create a parser (using <tt>make</tt>) and run it on your test program.
</ul>


<h3 id="astJava">Modifying <tt>ast.java</tt></h3>
<p class="reg">
We will test your program by using our <tt>unparse</tt>
methods on your abstract-syntax trees and by using your <tt>unparse</tt> methods
on our abstract-syntax trees.
To make this work, you will need to:
</p>
<ol class="reg">
  <li>Modify <tt>ast.java</tt> <b>only</b> by filling in
       the bodies of the <tt>unparse</tt> methods (and you must fill in all of the
       method bodies).
  <li>Make sure that no <tt>LinkedList</tt> field is null (i.e., when you call the
       constructor of a class with a <tt>LinkedList</tt> argument, that argument should
       never be null).
       Note that it is OK to make the <tt>ExpNode</tt> field of a <tt>ReturnStmtNode</tt> null
       (when no value is returned), likewise for the <tt>ExpListNode</tt> field of a <tt>CallExpNode</tt> (when the call has no arguments).
  <li>Follow the convention that the <tt>mySize</tt> field of a
       <tt>VarDeclNode</tt> has the value <tt>VarDeclNode.NOT_ARRAY</tt> if the type
       of the declared variable
       is a non-array type (i.e., if the declaration did not include
       square brackets).
</ol>


<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p class="reg">
Part of your task will be to write an input file called <tt>test.Mini</tt> that thoroughly
tests your parser and your unparser.
You should be sure to include code that corresponds to every grammar  rule in the file <tt>Mini.grammar</tt>.  
</p>
<p class="reg">Note that since you are to provide only <em>one</em> input file,
  <tt>test.Mini</tt> should contain no syntax errors (you should also test your
  parser on some bad inputs, but don't hand those in).
</p>
<p class="reg">You will probably find it helpful to use comments  in <tt>test.Mini</tt> to explain what aspects of the parser are  being tested, but your testing grade will depend only on how  thoroughly the file tests the parser.</p>
<h3 id="suggest">Suggestions for How to Work on This Assignment</h3>
<p class="reg">
This assignment involves three main tasks:
</p>
<ol class="reg">
  <li>Writing the parser specification (<tt>Mini.cup</tt>).</li>
  <li>Writing the unparse methods for the AST nodes (in <tt>ast.java</tt>).</li>
  <li>Writing an input file (<tt>test.Mini</tt>) to test your implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="reg">
If you work with a partner,  it is a good idea to share responsibility for all tasks  to ensure that both partners understand all aspects of the assignment.
</p>
<p class="reg">
I suggest that you proceed as follows, testing your parser
after each change
(if you are working alone, I still suggest that you follow the basic steps outlined below, just do them all yourself):
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="reg">Working together, start by making a very small change
       to <tt>Mini.cup</tt>.
       For example, add the rules and actions for:</p>
       <dir><pre>type ::= BOOL
type ::= VOID</pre></dir>
<p class="reg">
       Also update the appropriate <tt>unparse</tt> method in
       <tt>ast.java</tt>.
       Make sure that you can create and run the parser after making
       this small change.
         (To create the parser, just type <tt>make</tt> in the directory         where you are working.)
         </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">Next, add the rules needed to allow array declarations.
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="reg">Next, add the rules needed to allow programs to include functions
       with no formal parameters and with empty statement lists only, and update the
       corresponding <tt>unparse</tt> methods.
       </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">Still working together, add the rules (and <tt>unparse</tt> methods)
       for the simplest kind of expressions -- just plain identifiers.
       </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">Now divide up the statement nonterminals into two parts, one part for
       each person.
       </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">Each person should extend their own copy of <tt>Mini.cup</tt>
       by adding rules for their half of the statements, and should extend
       their own copy of <tt>ast.java</tt> to define the unparse methods
       needed for those statements.
       </p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="reg">Write test inputs for your statements and your partner's statements.
  </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">After each person makes sure that their parser and unparser
       work on their own statements, combine the two by cutting and
       pasting one person's grammar rules into the other person's
       <tt>Mini.cup</tt> (and similarly for <tt>ast.java</tt>).
       </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">Now divide up the expression nonterminals into two parts, and
       implement those using a similar approach.
       Note that you will also need to give the operators the right
       precedences and associativities during this step (see
       <a href="#prec">above</a>).
       </p></li>
  <li><p class="reg">Divide up any remaining productions that need to be added,
       and add them.
       </p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="reg">Talk about what needs to be tested, and decide together what your
       final version of <tt>test.Mini</tt> should include.
       </p></li>
  <li>
    <p class="reg">When working on your own, do <em>not</em> try to implement all of
       your nonterminals at once.  Instead, add one new rule at a time
       to the Java CUP specification, make the corresponding changes
       to the <tt>unparse</tt> methods in <tt>ast.java</tt>, and test
       your work by augmenting your <tt>test.Mini</tt> or by writing a Mini
       program that includes the new construct you added, and make sure
       that it is parsed and unparsed correctly.</p></li>
</ul>
